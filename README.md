# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

I wrote this code while working through Scott Barrett's data structures and algorithms course for Python. It contains from scratch implementations of several common data structures and sort algorithms, such as linked lists, graphs, trees, and hash tables.

Some of this code may differ a bit from what is published in the course since I tried to write the methods before actually watching the videos where he coded up the solutions. Still, the code here has equivalent functionality and time complexity.

My commenting throughout this repository is extremely verbose on purpose so that I can review these files potentially many months or years from now and not feel totally lost. And maybe if someone else looks at these, they also don't have to guess what I'm doing.
